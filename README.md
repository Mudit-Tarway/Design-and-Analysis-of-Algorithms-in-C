# Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms-in-C


This repository contains implementations of various algorithms in C, created as part of my college coursework for the subject Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA).

The goal of this repository is to record, organize, and maintain all the important algorithm codes in one place for easy access and reference.

*_ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure_*

The repository is organized into different categories of algorithms:

Sorting Algorithms â€“ Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort.

Divide and Conquer â€“ Merge Sort , Finding Max and Min element.

Greedy - Fractional Kanpsack

Other Important Algorithms â€“ as covered in coursework.
